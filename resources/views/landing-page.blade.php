      A rogue planet Earth0416J hemmed in the convergence of spiritual realm and physical realm by a red giant protostar was accidentally discovered by two promising botanist prodigies and partners <strong>Liam</strong> and <strong>Yam</strong> from a mysterious cave that turned out to be a portal. In this world, they met sworn-enemies and young practicing fairies the dauntless <strong>Diyes</strong> and modest <strong>Meg</strong>, who took upon themselves to fill their planet with plants that will eventually help sustain life in their world as it is rapidly diminishing due to the inexplicable indifference of other fairies. Can you help the quartet in their quest to save this mystifying world and rekindle life among the fairies?
