      The game will scale the actual length of time needed by the plants to grow and simulate regional geographical factors that affects plants such as snow, wind, rain, typhoon, cyclone, pests that could hinder full capacity of farmlands for produce.
      <br><br>
      Farm produce can also rot for non-sale after a certain period unless they are actual plants for re-selling which will need continuous nourishment and proper care.
      <br><br>
      Not logging in the game for a period may also result to <br>plants dying and ultimately loss of resources.
