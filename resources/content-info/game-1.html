  eventually sell to the marketplace. Marketplace will have several sections such as farm produce where fruits, flowers
  and full-grown plants are for sale, seedling/nursery section where plant seedlings and baby plants are sold, plant
  essentials where fertilizers, pots and other garden equipment are available, farmland where bigger land areas will be
  available depending on the level of experience of individual user.
